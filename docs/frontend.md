# Front End

The front end of the application is what it's all about. Users need a interface to work with. Developing these interfaces are often time consuming and that's what the Skeleton App is all about.

The Skeleton App is developed with React and in particular the GatsbyJs framework. For the commands below, you need to have NodeJS installed ([see the requirements](index.md))

Use the following command from the root folder to spin up the front-end:

```cli
cd pwa
npm install
npm run develop
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to view the app in your browser.

If you have the [back-end](backend.md) running as well, you can log in with these credentials:

```cli
Username : test@gateway.local
Password: !ChangeMe!

```
